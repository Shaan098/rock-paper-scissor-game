# 🎮 Rock Paper Scissors Game  
A simple, interactive, and visually appealing **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project recreates the classic hand game where the player competes against the computer with real-time results, animations, scoring, and autoplay features.
